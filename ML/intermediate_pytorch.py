NLP From Scratch: Classifying Names with a Character-Level RNN
**************************************************************

We will be building and training a basic character-level RNN to classify
words. This tutorial, along with the following two, show how to do
preprocess data for NLP modeling "from scratch", in particular not using
many of the convenience functions of `torchtext`, so you can see how
preprocessing for NLP modeling works at a low level.

A character-level RNN reads words as a series of characters -
outputting a prediction and "hidden state" at each step, feeding its
previous hidden state into each next step. We take the final prediction
to be the output, i.e. which class the word belongs to.

Specifically, we'll train on a few thousand surnames from 18 languages
of origin, and predict which language a name is from based on the
spelling:

::

    $ python predict.py Hinton
    (-0.47) Scottish
    (-1.52) English
    (-3.57) Irish

    $ python predict.py Schmidhuber
    (-0.19) German
    (-2.48) Czech
    (-2.68) Dutch

Preparing the Data
==================

.. Note::
   Download the data from
   `here <https://download.pytorch.org/tutorial/data.zip>`_
   and extract it to the current directory.

Included in the ``data/names`` directory are 18 text files named as
"[Language].txt". Each file contains a bunch of names, one name per
line, mostly romanized (but we still need to convert from Unicode to
ASCII).

We'll end up with a dictionary of lists of names per language,
``{language: [names ...]}``. The generic variables "category" and "line"
(for language and name in our case) are used for later extensibility.

# Turning Names into Tensors
# --------------------------
#
# Now that we have all the names organized, we need to turn them into

#
# To represent a single letter, we use a "one-hot vector" of size
# ``<1 x n_letters>``. A one-hot vector is filled with 0s except for a 1
# at index of the current letter, e.g. ``"b" = <0 1 0 0 0 ...>``.
#
# To make a word we join a bunch of those into a 2D matrix
# ``<line_length x 1 x n_letters>``.
#
# That extra 1 dimension is because PyTorch assumes everything is in
# batches - we're just using a batch size of 1 here.
#

import torch

# Find letter index from all_letters, e.g. "a" = 0
def letterToIndex(letter):
    return all_letters.find(letter)

def letterToTensor(letter):
    tensor = torch.zeros(1, n_letters)
    tensor[0][letterToIndex(letter)] = 1
    return tensor

# Turn a line into a <line_length x 1 x n_letters>,
# or an array of one-hot letter vectors

    tensor = torch.zeros(len(line), 1, n_letters)

# Creating the Network
# ====================
#
# Before autograd, creating a recurrent neural network in Torch involved
# cloning the parameters of a layer over several timesteps. The layers
# held hidden state and gradients which are now entirely handled by the
# graph itself. This means you can implement a RNN in a very "pure" way,
# as regular feed-forward layers.
#
# This RNN module (mostly copied from `the PyTorch for Torch users
# tutorial <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/former_torchies/
# nn_tutorial.html#example-2-recurrent-net>`__)
# is just 2 linear layers which operate on an input and hidden state, with
# a LogSoftmax layer after the output.

NLP From Scratch: Generating Names with a Character-Level RNN
*************************************************************

This is our second of three tutorials on "NLP From Scratch".
In the `first tutorial </intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial>`
we used a RNN to classify names into their language of origin. This time
we'll turn around and generate names from languages.

::

    > python sample.py Russian RUS
    Rovakov
    Uantov
    Shavakov

    > python sample.py German GER

    > python sample.py Spanish SPA
    Salla
    Parer
    Allan

    > python sample.py Chinese CHI
    Chan
    Hang
    Iun

We are still hand-crafting a small RNN with a few linear layers. The big
difference is instead of predicting a category after reading in all the
letters of a name, we input a category and output one letter at a time.
Recurrently predicting characters to form language (this could also be
done with words or other higher order constructs) is often referred to
as a "language model".

# Creating the Network
# ====================
#
# This network extends `the last tutorial's RNN <#Creating-the-Network>`__
# with an extra argument for the category tensor, which is concatenated
# along with the others. The category tensor is a one-hot vector just like
# the letter input.
#
# We will interpret the output as the probability of the next letter. When
# sampling, the most likely output letter is used as the next input
# letter.
#
# I added a second linear layer ``o2o`` (after combining hidden and
# output) to give it more muscle to work with. There's also a dropout
# layer, which `randomly zeros parts of its
# input <https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580>`__ with a given probability
# (here 0.1) and is usually used to fuzz inputs to prevent overfitting.
# Here we're using it towards the end of the network to purposely add some

NLP From Scratch: Translation with a Sequence to Sequence Network and Attention
*******************************************************************************

This is the third and final tutorial on doing "NLP From Scratch", where we
write our own classes and functions to preprocess the data to do our NLP
modeling tasks. We hope after you complete this tutorial that you'll proceed to
learn how `torchtext` can handle much of this preprocessing for you in the
three tutorials immediately following this one.

In this project we will be teaching a neural network to translate from
French to English.

::

    [KEY: > input, = target, < output]

    > il est en train de peindre un tableau .
    = he is painting a picture .
    < he is painting a picture .

    > pourquoi ne pas essayer ce vin delicieux ?
    = why not try that delicious wine ?
    < why not try that delicious wine ?

    > elle n est pas poete mais romanciere .
    = she is not a poet but a novelist .
    < she not not a poet but a novelist .

    > vous etes trop maigre .
    = you re too skinny .
    < you re all alone .

... to varying degrees of success.

This is made possible by the simple but powerful idea of the `sequence
to sequence network <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>`__, in which two
recurrent neural networks work together to transform one sequence to
another. An encoder network condenses an input sequence into a vector,
and a decoder network unfolds that vector into a new sequence.

.. figure:: /_static/img/seq-seq-images/seq2seq.png
   :alt:

To improve upon this model we'll use an `attention
mechanism <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473>`__, which lets the decoder
learn to focus over a specific range of the input sequence.

**Recommended Reading:**

I assume you have at least installed PyTorch, know Python, and
understand Tensors:

-  https://pytorch.org/ For installation instructions
-  :doc:`/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz` to get started with PyTorch in general
-  :doc:`/beginner/pytorch_with_examples` for a wide and deep overview
-  :doc:`/beginner/former_torchies_tutorial` if you are former Lua Torch user


It would also be useful to know about Sequence to Sequence networks and
how they work:

-  `Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for
   Statistical Machine Translation <https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078>`__
-  `Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural
   Networks <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>`__
-  `Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and
   Translate <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473>`__
-  `A Neural Conversational Model <https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05869>`__

You will also find the previous tutorials on
:doc:`/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial`
and :doc:`/intermediate/char_rnn_generation_tutorial`
helpful as those concepts are very similar to the Encoder and Decoder
models, respectively.

# The Seq2Seq Model
# =================
#
# A Recurrent Neural Network, or RNN, is a network that operates on a
# sequence and uses its own output as input for subsequent steps.
#
# A `Sequence to Sequence network <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215>`__, or
# seq2seq network, or `Encoder Decoder
# network <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1078v3.pdf>`__, is a model
# consisting of two RNNs called the encoder and decoder. The encoder reads
# an input sequence and outputs a single vector, and the decoder reads
# that vector to produce an output sequence.
#
# .. figure:: /_static/img/seq-seq-images/seq2seq.png
#    :alt:
#
# Unlike sequence prediction with a single RNN, where every input
# corresponds to an output, the seq2seq model frees us from sequence
# length and order, which makes it ideal for translation between two
# languages.
#
# Consider the sentence "Je ne suis pas le chat noir" → "I am not the
# black cat". Most of the words in the input sentence have a direct
# translation in the output sentence, but are in slightly different
# orders, e.g. "chat noir" and "black cat". Because of the "ne/pas"
# construction there is also one more word in the input sentence. It would
# be difficult to produce a correct translation directly from the sequence
# of input words.
#
# With a seq2seq model the encoder creates a single vector which, in the
# ideal case, encodes the "meaning" of the input sequence into a single
# vector — a single point in some N dimensional space of sentences.
#


######################################################################
# The Encoder
# -----------
#
# The encoder of a seq2seq network is a RNN that outputs some value for
# every word from the input sentence. For every input word the encoder
# outputs a vector and a hidden state, and uses the hidden state for the
# next input word.
#

######################################################################
# The Decoder
# -----------
#
# The decoder is another RNN that takes the encoder output vector(s) and
# outputs a sequence of words to create the translation.
#


######################################################################
# Simple Decoder
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# In the simplest seq2seq decoder we use only last output of the encoder.
# This last output is sometimes called the *context vector* as it encodes
# context from the entire sequence. This context vector is used as the
# initial hidden state of the decoder.
#
# At every step of decoding, the decoder is given an input token and
# hidden state. The initial input token is the start-of-string ``<SOS>``
# token, and the first hidden state is the context vector (the encoder's
# last hidden state).
#
# .. figure:: /_static/img/seq-seq-images/decoder-network.png
#    :alt:
#
#

class DecoderRNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(DecoderRNN, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size

######################################################################
# I encourage you to train and observe the results of this model, but to
# save space we'll be going straight for the gold and introducing the
# Attention Mechanism.
#


######################################################################
# Attention Decoder
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# If only the context vector is passed between the encoder and decoder,
# that single vector carries the burden of encoding the entire sentence.
#
# Attention allows the decoder network to "focus" on a different part of
# the encoder's outputs for every step of the decoder's own outputs. First
# we calculate a set of *attention weights*. These will be multiplied by
# the encoder output vectors to create a weighted combination. The result
# (called ``attn_applied`` in the code) should contain information about
# that specific part of the input sequence, and thus help the decoder
# choose the right output words.
#
# .. figure:: https://i.imgur.com/1152PYf.png
#    :alt:
#
# Calculating the attention weights is done with another feed-forward
# layer ``attn``, using the decoder's input and hidden state as inputs.
# Because there are sentences of all sizes in the training data, to
# actually create and train this layer we have to choose a maximum
# sentence length (input length, for encoder outputs) that it can apply
# to. Sentences of the maximum length will use all the attention weights,
# while shorter sentences will only use the first few.

# Training the Model
# ------------------
#
# To train we run the input sentence through the encoder, and keep track
# of every output and the latest hidden state. Then the decoder is given
# the ``<SOS>`` token as its first input, and the last hidden state of the
# encoder as its first hidden state.
#
# "Teacher forcing" is the concept of using the real target outputs as
# each next input, instead of using the decoder's guess as the next input.
# Using teacher forcing causes it to converge faster but `when the trained
# network is exploited, it may exhibit
# instability <http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.378.4095&rep=rep1&type=pdf>`__.
#
# You can observe outputs of teacher-forced networks that read with
# coherent grammar but wander far from the correct translation -
# intuitively it has learned to represent the output grammar and can "pick
# up" the meaning once the teacher tells it the first few words, but it
# has not properly learned how to create the sentence from the translation
# in the first place.
#
# Because of the freedom PyTorch's autograd gives us, we can randomly
# choose to use teacher forcing or not with a simple if statement. Turn
# ``teacher_forcing_ratio`` up to use more of it.

Reinforcement Learning (DQN) Tutorial
=====================================



This tutorial shows how to use PyTorch to train a Deep Q Learning (DQN) agent
on the CartPole-v0 task from the `OpenAI Gym <https://www.gymlibrary.ml/>`__.

**Task**

The agent has to decide between two actions - moving the cart left or
right - so that the pole attached to it stays upright. You can find an
official leaderboard with various algorithms and visualizations at the
`Gym website <https://www.gymlibrary.ml/environments/classic_control/cart_pole>`__.

.. figure:: /_static/img/cartpole.gif
   :alt: cartpole

   cartpole

As the agent observes the current state of the environment and chooses
an action, the environment *transitions* to a new state, and also
returns a reward that indicates the consequences of the action. In this
task, rewards are +1 for every incremental timestep and the environment
terminates if the pole falls over too far or the cart moves more then 2.4
units away from center. This means better performing scenarios will run
for longer duration, accumulating larger return.

The CartPole task is designed so that the inputs to the agent are 4 real
values representing the environment state (position, velocity, etc.).
However, neural networks can solve the task purely by looking at the
scene, so we'll use a patch of the screen centered on the cart as an
input. Because of this, our results aren't directly comparable to the
ones from the official leaderboard - our task is much harder.
Unfortunately this does slow down the training, because we have to
render all the frames.

Strictly speaking, we will present the state as the difference between
the current screen patch and the previous one. This will allow the agent
to take the velocity of the pole into account from one image.

**Packages**


First, let's import needed packages. Firstly, we need
`gym <https://github.com/openai/gym>`__ for the environment
(Install using `pip install gym`).
We'll also use the following from PyTorch:

-  neural networks (``torch.nn``)
-  optimization (``torch.optim``)
-  automatic differentiation (``torch.autograd``)
-  utilities for vision tasks (``torchvision`` - `a separate
   package <https://github.com/pytorch/vision>`__).

# Replay Memory
# -------------
#
# We'll be using experience replay memory for training our DQN. It stores
# the transitions that the agent observes, allowing us to reuse this data
# later. By sampling from it randomly, the transitions that build up a
# batch are decorrelated. It has been shown that this greatly stabilizes
# and improves the DQN training procedure.
#
# For this, we're going to need two classses:
#
# -  ``Transition`` - a named tuple representing a single transition in
#    our environment. It essentially maps (state, action) pairs
#    to their (next_state, reward) result, with the state being the
#    screen difference image as described later on.
# -  ``ReplayMemory`` - a cyclic buffer of bounded size that holds the
#    transitions observed recently. It also implements a ``.sample()``
#    method for selecting a random batch of transitions for training.
#

######################################################################
# Now, let's define our model. But first, let's quickly recap what a DQN is.
#
# DQN algorithm
# -------------
#
# Our environment is deterministic, so all equations presented here are
# also formulated deterministically for the sake of simplicity. In the
# reinforcement learning literature, they would also contain expectations
# over stochastic transitions in the environment.
#
# Our aim will be to train a policy that tries to maximize the discounted,
# cumulative reward
# :math:`R_{t_0} = \sum_{t=t_0}^{\infty} \gamma^{t - t_0} r_t`, where
# :math:`R_{t_0}` is also known as the *return*. The discount,
# :math:`\gamma`, should be a constant between :math:`0` and :math:`1`
# that ensures the sum converges. It makes rewards from the uncertain far
# future less important for our agent than the ones in the near future
# that it can be fairly confident about.
#
# The main idea behind Q-learning is that if we had a function
# :math:`Q^*: State \times Action \rightarrow \mathbb{R}`, that could tell
# us what our return would be, if we were to take an action in a given
# state, then we could easily construct a policy that maximizes our
# rewards:
#
# .. math:: \pi^*(s) = \arg\!\max_a \ Q^*(s, a)
#
# However, we don't know everything about the world, so we don't have
# access to :math:`Q^*`. But, since neural networks are universal function
# approximators, we can simply create one and train it to resemble
# :math:`Q^*`.
#
# For our training update rule, we'll use a fact that every :math:`Q`
# function for some policy obeys the Bellman equation:
#
# .. math:: Q^{\pi}(s, a) = r + \gamma Q^{\pi}(s', \pi(s'))
#
# The difference between the two sides of the equality is known as the
# temporal difference error, :math:`\delta`:
#
# .. math:: \delta = Q(s, a) - (r + \gamma \max_a Q(s', a))
#
# To minimise this error, we will use the `Huber
# loss <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huber_loss>`__. The Huber loss acts
# like the mean squared error when the error is small, but like the mean
# absolute error when the error is large - this makes it more robust to
# outliers when the estimates of :math:`Q` are very noisy. We calculate
# this over a batch of transitions, :math:`B`, sampled from the replay
# memory:
#
# .. math::
#
#    \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{|B|}\sum_{(s, a, s', r) \ \in \ B} \mathcal{L}(\delta)
#
# .. math::
#
#    \text{where} \quad \mathcal{L}(\delta) = \begin{cases}
#      \frac{1}{2}{\delta^2}  & \text{for } |\delta| \le 1, \\
#      |\delta| - \frac{1}{2} & \text{otherwise.}
#    \end{cases}
#
# Q-network
# ^^^^^^^^^
#
# Our model will be a convolutional neural network that takes in the
# difference between the current and previous screen patches. It has two
# outputs, representing :math:`Q(s, \mathrm{left})` and
# :math:`Q(s, \mathrm{right})` (where :math:`s` is the input to the
# network). In effect, the network is trying to predict the *expected return* of
# taking each action given the current input.

Spatial Transformer Networks Tutorial
=====================================
**Author**: `Ghassen HAMROUNI <https://github.com/GHamrouni>`_

.. figure:: /_static/img/stn/FSeq.png

In this tutorial, you will learn how to augment your network using
a visual attention mechanism called spatial transformer
networks. You can read more about the spatial transformer
networks in the `DeepMind paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02025>`__

Spatial transformer networks are a generalization of differentiable
attention to any spatial transformation. Spatial transformer networks
(STN for short) allow a neural network to learn how to perform spatial
transformations on the input image in order to enhance the geometric
invariance of the model.
For example, it can crop a region of interest, scale and correct
the orientation of an image. It can be a useful mechanism because CNNs
are not invariant to rotation and scale and more general affine
transformations.

One of the best things about STN is the ability to simply plug it into
any existing CNN with very little modification.

# Depicting spatial transformer networks
# --------------------------------------
#
# Spatial transformer networks boils down to three main components :
#
# -  The localization network is a regular CNN which regresses the
#    transformation parameters. The transformation is never learned
#    explicitly from this dataset, instead the network learns automatically
#    the spatial transformations that enhances the global accuracy.
# -  The grid generator generates a grid of coordinates in the input
#    image corresponding to each pixel from the output image.
# -  The sampler uses the parameters of the transformation and applies
#    it to the input image.
