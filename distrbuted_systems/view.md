Define Bandwidth and Latency?

 Bandwidth of a network is given by the number of bits that can be transmitted over the network in a certain period of time. 
 Latency corresponds to how long it takes a message to travel from one end off a network to the other. 
 It is strictly measured in terms of time.
 
 Routing?
 
 Routing is the process of moving packets across a network from one host to a another.
 It is usually performed by dedicated devices called routers. 
 
 RTD/RTT--round-trip delay time (RTD) or round-trip time (RTT) is the length of time it takes for a signal to be sent,
 plus the length of time it takes for an acknowledgment of that signal to be received.
 This time delay therefore consists of the propagation times between the two points of a signal.
