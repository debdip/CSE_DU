studied different semantic segmentation network(FCN,PSPnet) in order to segment and localize as well as predict distance
from camera with different orientation in autonomous car simulator project. Wrote python client program which takes necessary 
information from autonomous car simulator server and sends control command to run the car in the simulator environment.

Studied about Reinforcement learning for a virtual robot to learn from simulator environment (similar to NVIDIA Issac robot simulator).
